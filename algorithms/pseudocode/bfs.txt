Input: Graph G, starting node and target node
Output: Shortest path from the starting node to the target node in graph G (if such path exists)

1. Put only starting node in queue S
2. While queue S is not empty do
3. Take the begining of the queue S as N
4. If N is the target node 
5. Then inform that the path has been found and reconstruct it (going backwards from the target node)
6. For every descendant M of node N for which parent is not defined do
7. Remember N as parent of M and add it to the end of queue S
8. Inform that requested path doesn't exist
