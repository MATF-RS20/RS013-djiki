Input: Graph G and (random)starting node
Output: MST (Minimum cost Spanning Tree)

1. Mark starting node as reached and all other nodes as unreached
2. While there are unreached nodes do
3. 	Find an edge E with minimum cost in the graph that connects a reached node X to an unreached node Y
4. 	Add E to the MST and mark Y as reached
