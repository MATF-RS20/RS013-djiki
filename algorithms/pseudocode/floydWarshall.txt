Input: Graph G (n nodes)
Output: Shortest path from between all pairs of nodes

1. Let DIST be a n x n matrix of minimum distances initialized to infinity
2. For each edge (u, v) in G do
3. Set DIST[u][v] to weight of edge (u, v)
4. For each node v do
5. set DIST[v][v] to 0
6. For k in range 1 to n
7. For i in range 1 to n
8. For j in range 1 to n
9. If DIST[i][j] > DIST[i][k] + DIST[k][j]
10. Then set DIST[i][j] to DIST[i][k] + DIST[k][j]
11. Return matrix of distances
