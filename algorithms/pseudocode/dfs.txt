1. Put starting node on stack PATH
2. Insert starting node in the SET OF VISITED NODES
3. While stack PATH is not empty do
4. Take the top of the stack as N
5. If N is the target node 
6. Then inform that the path has been found and reconstruct it from the stack PATH
7. Else if N has no unvisited descendants 
8. Then remove N from stack PATH
9. Else choose first unvisited descendant and add it on top of the stack PATH and in the SET OF VISITED NODES
10. Inform that requested path doesn't exist
